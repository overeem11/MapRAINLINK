# MapRAINLINK
Python script to visualize rain gauge, radar, and commercial microwave link (CML) locations and their rainfall estimates on a map. This Python script is more widely applicable. It can be used to plot lines and/or points (and their values) on a map, not necessarily CML paths and rain gauge locations, and not necessarily rainfall intensities or accumulations. It can also be used to plot other data fields.

This script is meant as a replacement of the visualization by the open-source R package RAINLINK for Dutch radar data and commercial microwave link data. RAINLINK (https://github.com/overeem11/RAINLINK) is a retrieval algorithm for rainfall mapping from microwave links in a cellular communication network. MapRAINLINK works with output data from RAINLINK, irrespective of the RAINLINK version. MapRAINLINK can be of general use for opportunistic sensing data, such as those from CML and personal weather stations (PWS).

More tools for working with OPERA radar data, and the derived climatological dataset EURADCLIM, can be found here: https://github.com/overeem11/EURADCLIM-tools
